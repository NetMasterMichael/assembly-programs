# x86-assembly-programs
Welcome to my repository of assembly programs I've written as I learn x86 assembly. The programs you'll find in here range from very short programs that "do nothing perfectly", to hopefully some more interesting programs down the line! I have made this repository public so that anyone who is interested in assembly may see some workng examples.

I have decided to take on the challenge to learn assembly for the following reasons:
- 🖥️  As a primer for progressing onto OS development
- 🔍 To improve my malware analysis skills
- 💪 To challenge myself to learn something harder than a high-level language, no more nice abstractions
- 🛠️  Because I am interested in controlling the hardware at the very lowest level!

I hope that you may find something in here that intrigues you. I will be adding more files here over time as I learn more assembly.

Instructions on assembling and linking each program from the source code is included in each folder.
- elf32 folder: 32-bit assembly programs for Linux 🐧
- More to come!
